For this landing page, I used a clean and modern layout to highlight the store products clearly. The header includes a navigation bar with simple links and a cart dropdown to make the page easy to navigate. A carousel was added under the header to create a strong visual introduction and make the landing page more dynamic. The product section is organized using four product cards, each containing an image, product name, short description, and a “Shop Now” button to encourage user interaction. Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI were used to ensure consistent styling, ready-made components, and faster development. To improve responsiveness, the product cards use flexible sizing and a media query was added so the layout adapts smoothly on smaller screens by stacking the cards vertically for a mobile-friendly experience.
